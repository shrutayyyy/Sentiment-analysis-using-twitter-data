# Sentiment-analysis-using-twitter-data
This sample of code consists of a bunch of data cleaning, data analysis, feature engineering, and hit-and-trial of a bunch of machine learning algorithms. 
The objective of this piece of code is to firstly predict what typos or typing errors are being made, and which gender makes them more and to predict what is the sentiment behind each tweet.
This model could help us in filtering out hate speech in the future, so as to get rid of spam and negativity/cyber bullying on social media platforms.
